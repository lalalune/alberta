> **Warning:** This framework is under active research development. The API is unstable and subject to breaking changes between releases. It is not intended for production use.

A JAX-based research framework implementing components of [The Alberta Plan for AI Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11173) in the pursuit of building the foundations of Continual AI.


> "The agents are complex only because they interact with a complex world... their initial design is as simple, general, and scalable as possible." — *Sutton et al., 2022*

## Overview

The Alberta Framework provides foundational components for continual reinforcement learning research. Built on JAX for hardware acceleration, the framework emphasizes temporal uniformity every component updates at every time step, with no special training phases or batch processing.

## Project Context

This framework is developed as part of my D.Eng. work focusing on the foundations of online, continuious Reinforcement Learning (RL). For more background and context see:

### Roadmap

Depending on my research trajectory I may or may not implement every component required for the Alberta Plan. The current package includes production-facing kernels through Step 4, while the broad research claims remain deliberately scoped to the evidence that has actually been run.

| Step | Focus | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Fixed-feature continual supervised learning | **Complete** |
| 2 | Supervised nonlinear feature finding | **Supervised matrix accepted; broader representation discovery remains research** |
| 3 | GVF predictions, Horde-style architecture | **Given-feature GVF/Horde accepted; off-policy nonlinear Horde and feature discovery open** |
| 4 | Continual control | **SARSA accepted; actor-critic implemented but not canonical** |
| 5-6 | Average reward and continuing control | Planned |
| 7-12 | Hierarchical, multi-agent, world models | Future |

## Installation

```bash
pip install alberta-framework

# With optional dependencies
pip install alberta-framework[gymnasium]  # RL environment support
pip install alberta-framework[dev]        # Development (pytest, ruff)
```

**Requirements:** Python >= 3.13, JAX >= 0.4, NumPy >= 2.0

## Quick Start

```python
import jax.random as jr
from alberta_framework import (
    LinearLearner, MLPLearner, LMS, IDBD, Autostep,
    ObGDBounding, AGCBounding, EMANormalizer, WelfordNormalizer,
    RandomWalkStream, run_learning_loop, run_mlp_learning_loop,
)

stream = RandomWalkStream(feature_dim=10, drift_rate=0.001)

# --- Optimizers ---

# Fixed step-size baseline
learner = LinearLearner(optimizer=LMS(step_size=0.01))

# IDBD: per-weight adaptive step-sizes via gradient correlation (Sutton, 1992)
learner = LinearLearner(optimizer=IDBD())

# Autostep: tuning-free adaptation with gradient normalization (Mahmood et al., 2012)
learner = LinearLearner(optimizer=Autostep())

# --- Adding a Normalizer ---

# EMA normalization for non-stationary feature scales
learner = LinearLearner(optimizer=IDBD(), normalizer=EMANormalizer(decay=0.99))

# Welford normalization for stationary distributions
learner = LinearLearner(optimizer=Autostep(), normalizer=WelfordNormalizer())

# --- Adding a Bounder ---

# ObGD bounding prevents overshooting (Elsayed et al., 2024)
learner = LinearLearner(optimizer=Autostep(), bounder=ObGDBounding(kappa=2.0))

# --- MLP Learner ---

# MLP with Autostep + ObGD bounding + normalization
mlp = MLPLearner(
    hidden_sizes=(128, 128),
    optimizer=Autostep(),
    bounder=ObGDBounding(kappa=2.0),
    normalizer=EMANormalizer(decay=0.99),
)

# MLP with AGC bounding — per-unit clipping scaled by weight norm (Brock et al., 2021)
mlp = MLPLearner(
    hidden_sizes=(128, 128),
    optimizer=Autostep(),
    bounder=AGCBounding(clip_factor=0.01),
)

# --- Training ---

# Linear: JIT-compiled training via jax.lax.scan
state, metrics = run_learning_loop(learner, stream, num_steps=10000, key=jr.key(42))

# MLP: same interface
state, metrics = run_mlp_learning_loop(mlp, stream, num_steps=10000, key=jr.key(42))
```

## Core Components

### Composable Architecture

Learners accept three independent, composable concerns:
- **Optimizer** — per-weight step-size adaptation (LMS, IDBD, Autostep)
- **Bounder** — optional global update bounding (ObGDBounding)
- **Normalizer** — optional online feature normalization (EMANormalizer, WelfordNormalizer)

```python
from alberta_framework import (
    LinearLearner, MLPLearner, Autostep, ObGDBounding, AGCBounding, EMANormalizer
)

# Linear learner with Autostep + normalization
learner = LinearLearner(
    optimizer=Autostep(),
    normalizer=EMANormalizer(decay=0.99),
)

# MLP with Autostep + ObGD bounding + normalization
mlp = MLPLearner(
    hidden_sizes=(128, 128),
    optimizer=Autostep(),
    bounder=ObGDBounding(kappa=2.0),
    normalizer=EMANormalizer(decay=0.99),
)

# MLP with AGC bounding (per-unit clipping scaled by weight norm)
mlp_agc = MLPLearner(
    hidden_sizes=(128, 128),
    optimizer=Autostep(),
    bounder=AGCBounding(clip_factor=0.01),
    normalizer=EMANormalizer(decay=0.99),
)
```

### Optimizers

**Supervised Learning:**
- **LMS**: Fixed step-size baseline
- **IDBD**: Per-weight adaptive step-sizes via gradient correlation (Sutton, 1992). MLP support via Meyer's adaptation — replaces `x²` with `(∂y/∂w)²` in the h-decay term ([Meyer](https://github.com/ejmejm/phd_research/blob/main/phd/jax_core/optimizers/idbd.py))
- **Autostep**: Tuning-free adaptation with gradient normalization (Mahmood et al., 2012)

**TD Learning:**
- **TDIDBD**: TD learning with per-weight adaptive step-sizes and eligibility traces (Kearney et al., 2019)
- **AutoTDIDBD**: TD learning with AutoStep-style normalization for improved stability

### Bounders

- **ObGDBounding**: Dynamic update bounding to prevent overshooting (Elsayed et al., 2024). Decoupled from the optimizer so it can be composed with any optimizer.
- **AGCBounding**: Adaptive Gradient Clipping — per-unit clipping scaled by weight norm (Brock et al., 2021). Finer-grained than ObGD's global scaling.

### Normalizers

Online feature normalization for handling varying feature scales:
- **EMANormalizer**: Exponential moving average — suitable for non-stationary distributions
- **WelfordNormalizer**: Welford's algorithm with Bessel's correction — suitable for stationary distributions

### MLP Learner

Multi-layer perceptron for nonlinear function approximation (Elsayed et al., 2024):

```python
from alberta_framework import MLPLearner, ObGDBounding, RandomWalkStream, run_mlp_learning_loop
import jax.random as jr

stream = RandomWalkStream(feature_dim=10)
learner = MLPLearner(
    hidden_sizes=(128, 128),
    step_size=1.0,
    bounder=ObGDBounding(kappa=2.0),
    sparsity=0.9,
)
state, metrics = run_mlp_learning_loop(learner, stream, num_steps=10000, key=jr.key(42))
```

### Streams

Non-stationary experience generators implementing the `ScanStream` protocol:

- `RandomWalkStream`: Gradual target drift
- `AbruptChangeStream`: Sudden target switches
- `PeriodicChangeStream`: Sinusoidal oscillation
- `DynamicScaleShiftStream`: Time-varying feature scales
- `ScaleDriftStream`: Continuous feature scale drift

### TD Learning

For temporal-difference learning with value function approximation:

```python
from alberta_framework import TDLinearLearner, TDIDBD, run_td_learning_loop

learner = TDLinearLearner(optimizer=TDIDBD(trace_decay=0.9))
state, metrics = run_td_learning_loop(learner, td_stream, num_steps=10000, key=jr.key(42))
```

### Gymnasium Integration

```python
from alberta_framework.streams.gymnasium import collect_trajectory, learn_from_trajectory, PredictionMode
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
observations, targets = collect_trajectory(env, policy, num_steps=10000, mode=PredictionMode.REWARD)
state, metrics = learn_from_trajectory(learner, observations, targets)
```

### Publication Tools

Multi-seed experiments with statistical analysis and publication-ready outputs:

```python
from alberta_framework.utils import ExperimentConfig, run_multi_seed_experiment, pairwise_comparisons

results = run_multi_seed_experiment(configs, seeds=30, parallel=True)
significance = pairwise_comparisons(results, test="ttest", correction="bonferroni")
```
